# openfoam_cases
Studying openfoam with cases , major method is simpleFoam .

  1.Air_around_buildings , replace buildings.obj.gz with other buildings model in \constant\triSurface\ folder .
  2&3&4 , cases are about cars , F1 and cybertruck , (case 3 is too big to upload.)
  5 , case is about a UAV , with low speed .
  6&7 , air fighters , F22 and Su57 , but the F22 model is not good engough , please replace if you wanna a better simulation .
  8 , Audi R8 simulation , with a refine region , model is perfect .
